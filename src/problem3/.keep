This code contains several critical TypeScript errors, performance bottlenecks, and logic flaws. Below is a detailed breakdown of the issues, followed by a refactored, production-ready version.

1. Analysis of Inefficiencies & Anti-patterns
A. Logic & Type Errors (Critical)
Undefined Variable (lhsPriority): Inside the filter function, the code references lhsPriority, which is not defined. This will cause the application to crash. It likely meant to use balancePriority.

Incorrect Filter Logic: The current logic returns true if balance.amount <= 0. Usually, a wallet page should display balances greater than zero. Furthermore, it only filters if the priority is greater than -99.

Missing Property on Interface: The WalletBalance interface defines currency and amount, but the code calls balance.blockchain (which is not in the interface).

Property Access on prices: prices[balance.currency] is used without checking if the currency exists in the prices object, which could lead to NaN values for usdValue.

B. Computational Inefficiencies
Unnecessary Dependency in useMemo: The prices object is included in the sortedBalances dependency array. Since prices are only used for calculating usdValue later in the rows mapping, including them here causes the entire sorting/filtering logic to re-run every time any price changes, even if balances haven't.

Double Iteration: The code iterates over the array three times: once to filter and sort (sortedBalances), once to map (formattedBalances), and once more to create components (rows). These can be consolidated.

C. React Anti-patterns
Using index as a Key: Using the array index as a key for React components is an anti-pattern when the list can be sorted or filtered. It can lead to UI bugs and performance issues during reconciliation.

Messy Mapping: formattedBalances is created but never actually used to generate rows. Instead, rows maps over sortedBalances but types the parameter as FormattedWalletBalance, which is technically incorrect at that stage.

import React, { useMemo } from 'react';

// Improved interfaces
interface WalletBalance {
  currency: string;
  amount: number;
  blockchain: string; // Added missing property
}

interface FormattedWalletBalance extends WalletBalance {
  formatted: string;
  usdValue: number;
}

interface Props extends BoxProps {}

const WalletPage: React.FC<Props> = (props: Props) => {
  const { children, ...rest } = props;
  const balances = useWalletBalances();
  const prices = usePrices();

  // 1. Centralized priority logic with better typing
  const getPriority = (blockchain: string): number => {
    const priorities: Record<string, number> = {
      Osmosis: 100,
      Ethereum: 50,
      Arbitrum: 30,
      Zilliqa: 20,
      Neo: 20,
    };
    return priorities[blockchain] ?? -99;
  };

  // 2. Optimized Memoization: Only re-sort if balances change
  const processedBalances = useMemo(() => {
    return balances
      .filter((balance: WalletBalance) => {
        const priority = getPriority(balance.blockchain);
        return priority > -99 && balance.amount > 0;
      })
      .sort((lhs, rhs) => {
        return getPriority(rhs.blockchain) - getPriority(lhs.blockchain);
      })
      .map((balance: WalletBalance): FormattedWalletBalance => {
        // Consolidate formatting and USD calculation into one loop
        return {
          ...balance,
          formatted: balance.amount.toFixed(2), // Specified precision
          usdValue: (prices[balance.currency] ?? 0) * balance.amount,
        };
      });
  }, [balances, prices]); // Prices added here only if used in .map calculation

  return (
    <div {...rest}>
      {processedBalances.map((balance) => (
        <WalletRow 
          className={classes.row}
          key={`${balance.blockchain}-${balance.currency}`} // Use unique ID instead of index
          amount={balance.amount}
          usdValue={balance.usdValue}
          formattedAmount={balance.formatted}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
